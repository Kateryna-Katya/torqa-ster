                  <ul>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Course Content Discrepancy:</strong> If the content of the provided course significantly
                          differs from the program stated on our website at the time of purchase.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Technical Faults on Our Side:</strong> In the event of critical technical issues on the
                          <strong>Torqa Ster</strong> platform that make learning impossible and were not resolved by our
                          team within a reasonable timeframe.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Cancellation During the "Cooling-off Period":</strong> If you decide to cancel the course
                          within 14 (fourteen) calendar days of payment, provided that you have not yet accessed a
                          significant volume of teaching materials (see the "Exceptions" section).
                      </li>

                      </li>
                      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The subject line must state: "Refund Request".</li>
                      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                          In the body of the email, provide complete information: your full name, the email used for

                      </li>
                      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                          After receiving your email, our support team will review your request and contact you with
                          further instructions.
                      </li>
                  </ol>

                  <h2>Processing Times and Methods</h2>
                  <p>
                      Once your request is approved, the refund will be processed within 7–14 business days.
                      Funds will be returned using the same method used for the original payment (to the same bank card
                      or account). Please note that the actual time for the funds to appear may depend on your bank's
                      processing regulations.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Exceptions and Limitations</h2>
                  <p>A refund cannot be issued if:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The request is submitted more than 14 calendar days after the payment date.</li>
                      <li>You have already studied or downloaded more than 50% of the course materials, regardless of the time elapsed since purchase.</li>
                      <li>
                          The inability to complete the training is due to technical issues on the user's side
                          (e.g., unstable internet connection or incompatible software).
                      </li>
                      <li>Other terms of the User Agreement have been violated on your part.</li>
                  </ul>
