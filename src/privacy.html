                      This Privacy Policy applies to personal data provided by the company's clients,
                      both for the provision of various types of services and for other interactions,
                      typically in electronic format, as well as for client participation in company promotions,
                      technical support, and warranty service.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      <strong>Torqa Ster</strong> reserves the right to make changes and additions to the current
                      provisions of the Privacy Policy, and these changes and additions will take priority over
                      current provisions. Please note that provided services may contain links to third parties
                      that have their own Privacy Policy provisions. In such cases, Torqa Ster is not responsible
                      for the content and compliance with the Privacy Policy provisions of any third-party company.
                      By providing their personal data, the client gives full consent to its processing by the
                      methods provided for by the current provisions of the company's Privacy Policy.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Procedure for Data Collection, Storage, and Destruction</h2>
                  <p>
                      Torqa Ster collects personal data only with the user's consent and exclusively to provide the
                      client with a service or feature that requires private information: purchases, participation
                      in promotions, warranties, and service. To prevent the leakage of client personal data,
                      a full complex of information security measures (technical and organizational) is used.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      The maximum storage period for client personal data is 75 years from the date the company
                      receives private information. In other cases, the company stores the client's personal data
                      until the termination of its activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      The destruction, depersonalization, or blocking of a client's personal data or part of it
                      is carried out to exclude the possibility of further processing of this information.
                  </p>

                  </ul>

                  <h2>Use of Cookies and Markers</h2>
                  <p>
                      Cookies allow the collection of the following information about the client: IP address /
                      operating system / browser type / referring site URLs. This is necessary to improve services
                      provided to the client (saving passwords on the site when the browser is closed, traffic
                      analysis, etc.). Web beacons are used to graphically display anonymized information about
                      users on the site (visitor/view counters). If desired, the client can prevent tracking of
                      their actions at any time by disabling Cookies.
                  </p>

                  <h2>User Rights</h2>
                  <p>
                      All clients can edit their personal data. If a user wishes to stop the processing of
                      their personal data, they should contact Torqa Ster by email at
                      <a href="mailto:support@torqa-ster.org">support@torqa-ster.org</a>.
